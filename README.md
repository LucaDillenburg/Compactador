# File Compressor and Decompressor
File compressor and decompressor that uses Huffman Compression Algorithm.
<br/>
All the data structures used were developed using only built-in elements.

## Example
You can find a "Lorem Ipsum" example and its compressed file in the repository. The ```ls -l``` commands shows as follows:
```
-rw-r--r-- 1 dillenburg dillenburg  94K Jun 25 22:44 compressed.yeah
-rw-r--r-- 1 dillenburg dillenburg 176K Jun 25 22:44 example.txt
```
This represents a 46.6% percent compression rate.
